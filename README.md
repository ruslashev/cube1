This is a repo containing ressurection of the original cube 1 source, aimed to
make it compile and work. Then improve or expand upon it.

I decided to commit a lot of binary files on purpose, so that anyone in the
future can just clone it without needing to find original source and content
archives, which hopefully will never get lost, but who can know for sure.
These are `cube_2005_08_29_src.zip` `cube_2005_08_29_unix.tar.gz` freely
availiable on the Internet.

The file `readme.txt` is the original readme distributed with source.

## The changes

First of all, I removed the editing. IMO there's no place for it, perhaps
there can be a standalone version separate from the game. Anyway, the
editing itself is inferior to the Cube 2's in-game editor.
